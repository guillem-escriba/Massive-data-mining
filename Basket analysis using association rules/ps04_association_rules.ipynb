    "<font size=\"+1\">For the first rule I would count how many transactions contain \"chips\" and \"beer\" (11) and then I would divide it by the total amount of transactions (30) so we obtain 11/30, I would do the same for the second rule but instead of using \"chips\" and \"beer\" I'd use \"olives\" and \"chips\" so it would be 11/30 too. For compute the confidence I would count how many transactions contain A = \"chips\" and \"beer\" which is 11 and how many of them also contain B = \"olives\" (11) so to compute the confidence we divide transactions with A and B by transactions with A so we get 11/11 this means that every time that \"chips\" and \"beer\" has been bought, \"olives\" have been bought also. The same for the second rule but now A and B are only 11 and A are 13 so we get 11/13 as confidence. Lastly to obtain the lift of the first rule we need to count how many times appear B = \"olives\" that are 17 and dividing by total trandactions to obtain the support of B that is 17/30 and then we divide the confidence computed previously by that support obtaining (11/11)/(17/30) = 1'76 that is the lift. For the second rule we do the same, first compute the support of B = \"beer\" which is 17/30 too and then we divide the confidence of A->B by the support B and we obtain (11/13)/(17/30) = 1'49 obtaining the lift.</font>"
